# Exploration of Machine Learning concepts and how we can apply these concepts and various models to build different industry level real world applications 

### Artificial Intelligence -> Machine Learning -> Deep Learning 

## Example Applications:
- A stock prediction model that predicts stock prices given time series data
- A music AI that aims to create top 100 music hits given past music hits, (uses NLP, Natural Language Processing)
- An AI that cleans data for us based on given parameters
